## 4. Feasibility And Risk Study

### 4.1. System Feasibility

For most existing systems, a tutor is chosen for the student while our system will allow pay per request students to choose their own tutor based on ratings and tutor's profile. Tutors are required to have own transport since they have to travel extensively to students homes, that may be difficult given the high price of fuel.Our system will limit travelling by providing the closest students to the closest tutors.For safety of both parties, we recommend public places to meet, should they want an in person session.

### 4.2. Technical Feasibility

#### 4.2.1. Hardware requirements:

#### End-Users

- The user will respectively need to at least have a smartphone, a laptop or tablet with Internet connection to be able to use the information system, web and mobile apps.

#### Admin

- The admin will respectively need to have internet connection, WIFI router, LAN or any other device that can hotspot another device that can access the internet using a web browser to be able to manage bookings and customers on the website portal.

#### 4.2.2. Software requirements:

Our system will be a three-tier where we will have a database and a web API.

##### Web Application

- Angular 15

##### Web API

- ASP.NET Core 4.7.2

### 4.3 Economic Feasibility

In the real world, to ensure that our system is economically feasible we would need to find the costs of hiring developers, hosting to the web, APIs, support and maintenance once our system is deployed. Since we are the developers, we eliminate the cost of hiring developers. On average hosting to the web in South Africa is R99 per month.

The money we make from charging the students will help us maintain our system. Full time subscribers will pay R180 per month, pay per request students who will require one on one session will pay R200 per session.Pay per request is a private tutoring session, that is why it is a little bit higher. Tutors will get paid 80% of the amount that we charge per student.

### 4.4 Operational Feasibility

Working with tutors and students during the entire design & implementations process to guide us since they will be users of our system. We will consider their input highly as we are designing the system for them to decrease resistance once the system is in the market. Our system will provide both tutors and students with a simple user interface that will make operations such as searching a tutor, booking a tutor, making a payments easy to perform.
